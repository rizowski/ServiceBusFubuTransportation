#Service Bus Ft. Fubu Transportation

Here is a project with several examples on how to use Fubu Transporation. This project was created because of a work presentation request. A blog post has been posted [here](blog.rizowski.net/what-is-a-service-bus/) which describes what the general purpose of a service bus is.

There are 4 examples in different branches.
 * Master (basic example)
 * errors (Error handling)
 * ignore (**failed** Ignoring certain handlers)
 * polling (setting up polling tasks)

 Hopefully this will give some help to those trying to set up Fubu. In this project I am using Fubu 1, some additional dependancy fixes will be needed in order to get it to work with Fubu 2.
